# Selection-sorting
Let's  discuss about what is selection sort and how it work .

First of all what is selection sort ?
 Selection Sort is an algorithm that select the smallest element from an unsorted list in each iteration and places that element at the beginning of the unsorted list.


Now, How selection sort work ? 

Step :- 1
Starting from the first element , we search the smallest element in the array by comparing it  , and replace it with the element in the first position .

Step :- 2
now, we move to the next element (Second position) , and look for smallest element prresent in the subarray , starting from index 1, till the last index.

Step :-  3
We  replace the element at the second position in the original array, or we can say at the first position in the subarray , with the second smallest element.

Step :- 4
This is repeated , until the array is completely sorted.
